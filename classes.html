/*  Classes are a template for creating objects. 
    They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. 
    Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.
    Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, 
    The class syntax has two components: class expressions and class declarations.
    Constructor method is a special method, It get initialized when a new instance of an object is created.
    We don't need to use the function keyword to create a functions inside the class.
    We don't declared variables using public, private, protected keywords unlike other programming languages.
    We can use the static keyword to create a static method. which is a method that is called on the class itself rather than on an instance of the class.
    get and set keywords are used to define a getter and a setter for an object. Which allows us to define a function to execute when the property is accessed.
    Use # for true private properties.
    Use _ as a naming convention to indicate that a property should be treated as private, but it remains accessible outside the class.\
    private properties cannot be accessed outside the class.
*/

//Let's create a class called  'Person' with a constructor method that takes in 3 parameters

 * @param {*} age 
 * @param {*} address 
 * Static methods cannot used inside the constructor method.

 * Static keyword is used to create a static method or property.

//Let's the Inheritance in classes
/**
* Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class. 
* The derived class inherits features from the base class, adding new features to it.
* The class which is inherited is called the base class and the class which inherits is called the derived class.
* We use the 'extends' keyword to inherit the base class.
* We use the 'super' keyword to call the constructor of the base class.
